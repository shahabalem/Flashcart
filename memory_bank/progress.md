# Progress

## What works
- Initial setup of Cline's Memory Bank documentation, including verification of all core files.
- Core memory bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `memory_book_initial.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`) are present and their content has been reviewed.
- Provided an explanation of "boilerplate" content to the user.

## What's left to build
- The actual language learning application (Django backend, database setup, API integrations, AI optimization, FSRF algorithm, etc.).
- Detailed documentation within the memory bank files as development progresses.

## Current status
The memory bank documentation has been initialized and updated to reflect the current state of the project and recent interactions. It is ready to be populated with further project details as work proceeds. The core project files (Django, Docker) are not in the current working directory, so direct interaction with the application's codebase is not possible from this location.

## Known issues
- Discrepancy between initial environment file listing and actual file system contents.
- Inability to access or execute commands in the main project root from the current working directory.

## Evolution of project decisions
- Initial focus on establishing a robust documentation system (Cline's Memory Bank) to ensure continuity and understanding across sessions.
- Acknowledgment that the primary development tasks for the language learning app will require access to the main project directory.
