# Progress

## What works
- Initial setup of Cline's Memory Bank documentation.
- Core memory bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `memory_book_initial.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`) are now present.

## What's left to build
- The actual language learning application (Django backend, Flutter frontend, database setup, API integrations, AI optimization, FSRF algorithm, etc.).
- Detailed documentation within the memory bank files as development progresses.

## Current status
The memory bank documentation is initialized and ready to be populated with project details as work proceeds. The core project files (Django, Docker) are not in the current working directory, so direct interaction with the application's codebase is not possible from this location.

## Known issues
- Discrepancy between initial environment file listing and actual file system contents.
- Inability to access or execute commands in the main project root from the current working directory.

## Evolution of project decisions
- Initial focus on establishing a robust documentation system (Cline's Memory Bank) to ensure continuity and understanding across sessions.
- Acknowledgment that the primary development tasks for the language learning app will require access to the main project directory.
