# Active Context

## Current work focus
Maintaining Cline's Memory Bank documentation and responding to user queries.

## Recent changes
Completed the "initialize memory book" task by verifying all core memory bank files are present and populated. Provided an explanation of "boilerplate" content.

## Next steps
Awaiting further instructions from the user.

## Active decisions and considerations
The initial file listing was inaccurate; relying on `list_files` for current directory contents. The project is a Django/Docker application, but I am currently in a documentation-only subdirectory. "Initialize memory bank" refers to my internal documentation process, not project setup.

## Important patterns and preferences
All core memory bank files must exist and be read at the start of every task.

## Learnings and project insights
The project uses Docker, Django, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL. The current working directory is likely a sub-directory of the main project.
