# Active Context

## Current work focus

Establishing the foundational project structure and development environment for the AI-Powered Language Learning Backend and its associated Flutter frontend. This includes setting up Docker-based orchestration for all services.

## Recent changes

- Created and configured the `backend/` directory with a Django project, an initial `core` app, a Python virtual environment, `requirements.txt`, `Dockerfile`, and `.dockerignore`.
- Created and configured the `frontend/` directory with a new Flutter project.
- Established a comprehensive `docker-compose.yml` at the project root to orchestrate the Django backend, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, and Celery worker services.
- Applied initial Django database migrations via Docker Compose.
- Confirmed that all core `memory_bank` files (`projectBrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `techContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `technical_conventions.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) are in place and correctly structured.

## Next steps

The memory bank initialization is complete. Proceed with implementing the core features outlined in `projectBrief.md`, starting with the user authentication API endpoint for registration within the Django backend.

## Active decisions and considerations

- The `technical_conventions.md` file has been consolidated and updated as the single source of truth for development guidelines.
- The project uses a polyglot persistence strategy (PostgreSQL for relational, MongoDB for document).
- All development will primarily occur within the Dockerized environment.
- Flutter frontend development will proceed in parallel, connecting to the exposed backend APIs.

## Important patterns and preferences

All core memory bank files must exist and be read at the start of every task. Maintain consistent adherence to `technical_conventions.md`.

## Learnings and project insights

The initial setup process confirmed the viability of a multi-container Dockerized environment for this project. The clear separation of backend and frontend responsibilities, orchestrated by Docker Compose, provides a robust and scalable foundation. The `memory_bank` is now fully initialized with all core files present, including the newly created `techContext.md`.
