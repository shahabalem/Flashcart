# Product Context

## Why this project exists
This project aims to provide a language learning application.

## Problems it solves
It solves the problem of inefficient language learning by offering features like automated dictionary API fetching, AI optimization, and a spaced repetition system (FSRF).

## How it should work
The application should allow users to import words, categorize them into decks, and learn through a repetition algorithm. It will have a backend powered by Django, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL, and a mobile frontend built with Flutter.

## User experience goals
The user experience should be intuitive and efficient, catering to users who prefer traditional learning methods and have limited time for study.
